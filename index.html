                    <p>I am currently studying Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College (Progress Campus). A very curious, dedicated and positive-minded person. Computer/Video Gaming was one of the things that I enjoy doing the most growing
                        up. I started with traditional Art until I got myself into Digital Art.
                        <br>I decided to challenge myself and take a software engineering course here in Canada, to enhance and expand more of my knowledge about arts and computers science, and as well as to test my intelligence. I had a couple of CSR
                        jobs around, considering a lot of physical effort and a strong mind before I considered going back to school and pursue something that can benefit me in the future and as well as to enjoy what I do for my future professional job.

                    <p> Back in the days, technologies are not well developed yet in country where I used to live, although I am somehow lucky enough with my generation for the wide range of opportunities around the corner and the continues innovation and
                        development of higher technologies from different parts of the world. Growing up, Art Crafts and Computer Gaming are one of the things I enjoye doing on my spare time. Most of the members in my family group were good at designing,
                        whether it's traditional or digital art and as well as having an excellent computer knowledge. I am mainly self-taught with a little formal training in arts and codings. I love to think outside the box and be curious more of things
                        and learn how to research more deeply through the internet of a topic or an article that will feed my mind, and also to read some informative blogs or instructions that will guide me through all the difficulties I will encounter.
                        And as well as to avoid being hacked. Going through things on the internet and just reading or watching articles, also improved my vocabulary and the way I communicate towardds other people.
                        <br><br>I studied Physical therapy for about 3 years and realized that it is not my passion and something that I will not enjoy doing in the future. I have also studied Hotel and Restaurant Management for couple of months but also
                        realized that it isn't right for me either, and then finally, I made up my mind and decided to choose something that I really enjoy doing a lot, which is Visual Arts and Design and I was all ready to pursue becoming a great artist
                        but there are certain things that cannot be avoided and had to move to different country to settle down. Learning and coping up with unfamiliar environment is what made my journey more challenging. A big fresh start, like a lost
                        girl in the city
                        <br><br>I have an adequate knowledge working with individuals for logo branding, business cards, flyers & etc. My first job is not anything related to Art nor Software Engineering Technology although, back when I was in Asia, I
                        have been exposed to making arts and playing with codes using HTML and CSS by performing basic web designing and I also did study Visual Arts and Designs, in the Philippines. I was in Customer Service for quite a while until I
                        convinced myself to go back to a College/University to finish a degree and take an Engineering course. It was quite a long process before I got all my paperworks done. Graphic Designing was one of my first choice although I would
                        want to make use of my computer skills and apply my designs to user interfaces so then, I selected Software Engineering Technology as my main course which I find it challenging to learn but fun and also I am doing a small business
                        sideline to support my financial incapabilities.
