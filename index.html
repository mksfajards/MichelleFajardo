                    <p>I am currently studying Software Engineering Technology at Centennial College (Progress Campus). A very curious, dedicated and positive-minded person. Computer/Video Gaming were one of the things that I enjoy doing the most, growing
                        up. Additionally, Designing is something that I love to do, digitally and traditionally. Until one day, I decided to challenge myself and take software engineering course in order to enhance and expand more of my knowledge with
                        arts in relation with computers, user interface and software applications and as well as to test my intelligence. I had couple of CSR jobs around which takes a lot of physical effort and strong mind before I chose to go back to
                        school and pursue something that will benefit me for my future and as well as to enjoy what I do for my future professional job.

                    <p> Back in the days, technologies are not well developed yet and I am somehow lucky enough with my generation because of the wide range of opportunities all around the places and the continues innovations and development of high technologies
                        of different companies, business owners and competitors. Growing up, art and computer gaming has always been part of my life. Most of the member in my family group were really good at designing, whether it is traditional or digital
                        art and as well as having an excellent computer skills and knowledge. Since I also love computer games, thinking outside the box is one of the thing that helped me go through some diffucult level/challenges. By means of thinking
                        outside the box is to be curious more of things and learning how to research more deeply through internet of a topic or an article with a sufficient amount of proof and reading some certain content or instructions that will guide
                        you to go through with the challenges. And as well as to avoid being hacked. By going through things in the internet and just by reading/watching articles, it will also improve your vocabulary and the way you communicate towards
                        other people.
                        <br><br>I studied Physical therapy for about 3 years and realized that it is not my passion and something that I do not enjoy doing. I have also studied Hotel and Restaurant Management for couple months but also realized that it
                        is not for me either, and finally, I decided to choose something that I really enjoy doing alot, which is Visual Arts and Design and I was all ready to pursue becoming a great artist but there are certain things in my life that
                        I have to accept and just learn how to live with it which made it more challenging because of the new environment and fresh start. Like a lost girl in the city
                        <br><br>My first job is not anything related to Art nor Software Engineering Technology. I was in a Customer Service for quite awhile until I decided to go back to a College/University and take Engineering class. Graphic Designing
                        was one of my first choice although I would want to make use of my computer skills and apply my designs into user interfaces so then, I selected Software Engineering Technology as my main course which I find it challenging to learn
                        but fun and also I am doing a small business sideline to support my financial incapabilities.</aside>
